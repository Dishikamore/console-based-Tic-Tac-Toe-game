# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
## Project Title
Console-based Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Project Description
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. It allows two players to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, taking turns to mark their spots on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner or a draw after every move and displays the results to the players. After the game ends, players are given the option to play again.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide an interactive and easy-to-play Tic-Tac-Toe game for users to enjoy on the console. The primary goal is to help beginners learn basic C++ programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and user input validation. Additionally, the project aims to offer a simple, clean user experience, while implementing a traditional game that is easy to understand and play.

## Key Features
- **Two-player mode**: Two players can take turns playing on the same console.
- **Simple User Interface**: The game board is displayed in a 3x3 grid format, with numbered positions that players can choose.
- **Input Validation**: The game ensures that players can only enter valid moves (1-9). Invalid inputs and already occupied cells are handled with appropriate error messages.
- **Game Status Check**: After each move, the game checks if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Play Again Option**: After the game ends, players are asked if they would like to play again.
- **Console-based**: The game is completely text-based and runs in a terminal or command prompt.
